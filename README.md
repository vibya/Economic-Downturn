# Economic Downturn

## Background
Back in 2007-2008 due to sub prime Housing market and weak employment growth, it was a major economic disaster when the stock market collapsed , Fannie mae and Freddie Mac Federal Agencies mortgage securities experienced a meltdown, contributing to a general credit crisis, and then evolved into a worldwide financial crisis.

Based on the different KPI's(Key performance indicators) I'm trying to predict the next recession. how will it impact the various sectors and what sectors are going to be blamed, How far the next recession is and if it is hiding somewhere in 2019? 


## Methodology
I will be using various ML Algorithms to predict the beginning of the next recession.
Algorithoms :
	1— Linear Discriminant Analysis. 
	2 — Classification and Regression Trees.
	3 — Naive Bayes. 
	4 — K-Nearest Neighbors. 
	5 — Learning Vector Quantization.  
	6 — Support Vector Machines. 
	7 — Bagging and Random Forest. 
	8 — Boosting and AdaBoost.
