It will mark the first time the so-called super-jumbo airliner has been flown overseas with a full passenger load and meal service. Most of the passengers will be Airbus and Lufthansa employees, though some reporters and photographers will also be aboard. Lufthansa has ordered 15 A380s and expects its first delivery in summer 2009. Meanwhile, another Airbus A380 &#151; this one without passengers and operated by a crew from the Australian airline Qantas &#151; is expected to arrive on the same day and at about the same time at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a joint statement by Airbus, the airport, the Los Angeles mayor&#8217;s office and Qantas. That flight will depart from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, where the A380 program has had unexpected manufacturing delays. Los Angeles International has long lagged in making the extensive renovations to terminal gates and taxiways to accommodate the double-decker airliner, and is still some time away from doing so. The A380 will park on a ramp at Los Angeles for publicity and ground-based tests. Airbus and some airlines with A380 orders have criticized Los Angeles International for falling behind on the renovations. The airport, which is competing with San Francisco as a major Pacific overseas gateway, recently began a $723.5 million modernization of its international terminal that will include at least two gates that can accommodate the A380. Qantas has ordered 20 A380s and expects its first delivery in summer 2008.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main":

Average daily car rental rates crept up again, to $69. Corporate pressure on business travelers to comply with booking policies held down the rate of increases, said Mike Streit, vice president of American Express Business Travel Advisory Services. The average air fare rates were calculated from hundreds of domestic and international routes negotiated for corporate clients by American Express, from discount coach to first class. The average rate for car rentals includes fuel, taxes and other charges. Among domestic hotels, average nightly rates rose most sharply in the cheapest niche, the budget category, to $179 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $150 in the comparable 2005 quarter.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Memo Pad"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2007-03-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Joe", "lastname": "SHARKEY"}], "original": "By JOE SHARKEY"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "549091cd38f0d847ca7e208b", "word_count": "697", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/business/27flier.html", "snippet": "Business travel is a lot like space travel.
