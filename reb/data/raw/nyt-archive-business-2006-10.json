Among them is Singapore Airlines, which is expected to be the first carrier to fly the A380. \u201cWe were supposed to inaugurate the A380 into service in June, so we\u2019re already experiencing lower capacity growth,\u201d said James Boyd, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, which planned to put its first A380 into service in December after the earlier delays. Airlines have been told that the A380, already long overdue, could be delayed as much as a year more because of in-cabin wiring and other assembly problems. To augment its long-haul capacity, Singapore, which has ordered 10 A380\u2019s, expects to take delivery of six long-range Boeing 777-300ER aircraft by the end of this year. Singapore is also preparing to announce upgrades in its first- and business-class cabins next month. Airbus has 159 orders for the A380, which can be configured to hold 450 to 853 passengers. The top A380 customer is Emirates, which had originally expected to begin using the first of the 45 A380\u2019s next month and now says its plans for the A380 are \u201cup in the air.\u201d Emirates is said to be considering seeking compensation from Airbus for the continuing delays.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "11", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Memo Pad"}, "keywords": [{"value": "Airbus Industrie", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Airlines and Airplanes", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Hotels and Motels", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}], "pub_date": "2006-10-10T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Joe", "lastname": "SHARKEY"}], "original": "By JOE SHARKEY"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "54a3c6f338f0d80267d29c22", "word_count": "480", "slideshow_credits": null}], "2006-10-11": [{"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/business/11wire-mcafee.html", "snippet": "The security software supplier found accounting discrepancies in its stock options grants....", "lead_paragraph": "The security software supplier found accounting discrepancies in its stock options grants.", "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "McAfee Executives Leave After Options Inquiry"}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-10-11T09:30:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By REUTERS", "organization": "REUTERS"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "54a3d47638f0d80267d29da9", "word_count": "226", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/business/11wire-options.html", "snippet": "Shelby Bonnie resigned following a review of the company's stock-options practices....", "lead_paragraph": "Shelby Bonnie resigned following a review of the company's stock-options practices.", "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "CNET C.E.O.
