The card provides access to a special security lane. Several other competitors are planning to enter the business but the main operator is Verified Identity Pass, whose Clear program has about 48,000 members and locations at Terminals 1, 4 and 7 at Kennedy International Airport, as well as at airports in Orlando, Fla.; Cincinnati; San Jose, Calif.; and Indianapolis. Verified Identity plans to open a lane soon at Terminal B in Newark.
