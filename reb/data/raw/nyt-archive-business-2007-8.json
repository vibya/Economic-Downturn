water and snacks to passengers on an airplane that has left the gate and remains parked on an airport apron under a new state law signed by Gov. Eliot Spitzer last week. The legislation, originally drafted by a state assemblyman from Queens, Michael N. Gianaris, would take effect Jan. 1, although the airline industry has said it is considering a legal challenge. The Airline Passengers Bill of Rights came in response to instances of passengers being stranded for hours on parked planes, with inadequate ventilation and food and deteriorating hygienic conditions.
